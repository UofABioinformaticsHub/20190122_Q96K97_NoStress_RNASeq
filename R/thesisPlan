  x DE analysis
  x GSEA
    x Wiki pathways
    x 50 Hallmark
    x KEGG
    - IRE
  - Compare p-values from GSEA and fry (using -log10) just for fun
  x Community detection using Ville's turnip & burdock
    x Only use significant pathways
    x Only use genes up to the leading edge
    x Find common genes between pathways that cluster together

2. Integration with 2017
  - Raw comparison
    - MDS/PCA
    - Include summary of Nhis as is
  - Dream
  - RUVSeq
  - GSEA (or fry)
  - meta analysis
  
3. Integration using alternative approaches
  - Singscore
  - Concordance (Blalock)
  
4. Analysis using other mutants (Psen2, Sorl1, Q96K97)
    - Do we include non-EOfAD's? (K97fs, Psen null)
    - Meta-analysis using Fisher's method & Stouffer's method (use all genesets)
  - WGCNA or Singscore
