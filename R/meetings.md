### Since last EOfAD Meeting


### Questions for EOfAD meeting


### Since last meeting w/ Steve


### Questions for Steve
- Syntax for functions or packages in thesis?
- Noticed that 2017 dataset was 75 bp, 2019 was 150 bp.
- H0 for linear analysis
- Volcano plot from Nhi

### To do

  
### Notes
- Samples were lyophilised for 1 hour @ 25Â°C
-Null hypothesis: ave fold change across bins is 0

### Past questions
- What is the difference between `exactTest()` and GLM methods? Why use GLM after RUVSeq?
  - Exact is two way, GLM can build more complex models and compare
  
- What does logFC represent when comparing more than two groups?
- Used exact test originally, but then glm after ruvseq, does this matter?
- Why does gene level variance box plot not show similar pattern to tightness of samples in PCA?
- What type of linear model did we use for the bin stuff?
- How to get plots used to determine validity of linear model?
- `exactTest()` doesn't use Fisher's exact test, but the equivalent for negative binomial distributed data?
