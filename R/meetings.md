### Since last meeting w/ Steve


### Questions
- Gender of my fish? Potential effects on metabolism depending on gender. Hence maybe this accounts for discrepency of prevelance of AD in females vs males?
- What is the difference between `exactTest()` and GLM methods? Why use GLM after RUVSeq?

### To do
