### Questions for EOfAD meeting


### Since last meeting w/ Steve
- Started WT Analysis

### Questions for Steve
- What is the difference between `exactTest()` and GLM methods? Why use GLM after RUVSeq?
  - Exact is two way, GLM can build more complex models and compare

### To do
- proportion of variance
- completely incorporate datasets into a single pipeline
- go through fastqc reports and get read lengths
- compare GC content (should be identical)
  - impacted by frag and read length but should have similar mean/medium
- PCA
