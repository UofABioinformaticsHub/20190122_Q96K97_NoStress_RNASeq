  - [x] DE analysis
  - [x] GSEA
    - [x] Wiki pathways
    - [x] 50 Hallmark
    - [x] KEGG
  - [] IRE
  - [] Compare p-values from GSEA and fry (using -log10) just for fun
  - [] Select best visualisation and zoom in on OXPHOS (`clusterProfiler::cnetplot()`)
  x Community detection using Ville's turnip & burdock
    x Only use significant pathways
    x Only use genes up to the leading edge
    x Find common genes between pathways that cluster together

2. [] Integration with 2017
  - Summary of 2017
    - [x] DGE Analysis
    - [x] GSEA Analysis
  - [x] Meta analysis of GSEA/fry results
    - Use -log10(p) & Fisher's Method
    - No easy visualisation...
  - [] Integration of counts
    1. [] Put counts in same dge list
    2. [] MDS/PCA
    3. [] Dream
      - [] DGE
      - [] GSEA/fry on Dream Results
    4. [] RUVSeq
      - [] Compare with Dream results (logFC vs logFC; -log10(p) vs -log10(p))
      - [] GSEA (or fry)

  
3. [] Integration using alternative approaches
  - [] Singscore
  - [] Concordance (Blalock)
  
4. [] Analysis using other mutants (Psen2, Sorl1, Q96K97)
    - Do we include non-EOfAD's? (K97fs, Psen null)
    - Meta-analysis using Fisher's method & Stouffer's method (use all genesets)
  - [] WGCNA or Singscore
